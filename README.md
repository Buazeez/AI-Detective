## What is this?

Ever wondered if you can tell when AI is making stuff up? This game puts you in the shoes of a detective who needs to find all the errors in AI responses. It's like a digital version of "spot the mistake" but with real AI content.

## How it works

1. **Pick a level** - Start with easy stuff like moon facts, work your way up to tricky statistics
2. **Read the AI response** - Look carefully for anything that seems wrong
3. **Click the mistakes** - When you spot an error, click on it to highlight it
4. **Get points** - The more mistakes you find, the higher your score
5. **Compete with friends** - See who can get the highest score on the leaderboard

## Features

- **10 different levels** covering science, history, geography, and more
- **Local leaderboard** - compete with your friends (data stays in your browser)
- **No signup required** - just pick a name and start playing
- **Works offline** - no internet needed after the first load
- **Mobile friendly** - play on your phone or tablet

## Running locally

If you want to run this on your own computer:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Buazeez/AI-Detective.git
cd AI-Detective

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Tech stuff

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. No backend needed - everything runs in your browser. The game uses preloaded content with intentional errors, so no API keys or external services required.

## Why we built this

AI is everywhere now, but most people don't know how to tell when it's wrong. This game teaches critical thinking skills that students will need as AI becomes more common in their lives.

Built for the UNSW AI Hackathon 2024.
