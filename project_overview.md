üéØ Executive Summary
AI Detective: Hallucination Hunt is a revolutionary web-based educational game designed to teach critical AI literacy skills to students aged 11-16 (Years 7-10). Players act as AI detectives, crafting prompts and identifying hallucinations, biases, and errors in AI-generated responses. The game combines engaging gameplay mechanics with sophisticated psychological design to create an addictive learning experience that addresses one of the most urgent educational needs of the 21st century.
Key Innovation
Unlike traditional educational games with pre-written content, our game uses dynamic prompt-based learning where students write their own prompts based on specific task briefs and analyze real AI responses containing intentional hallucinations, creating unlimited, personalized educational content that teaches both prompt engineering and critical AI evaluation.
